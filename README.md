# High dimensional Immune profiling following Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis   

PAPER ABSTRACT 

Here we provide all codes and datasets required to reproduce the analysis presented in our relevant publication

## Publication

Title: High dimensional Immune profiling following Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis   

Journal: The paper is submitted to Nature Communications jourmal 

Published: pre-print available at bioRxiv 

## Code Description

The framework is presented using different R Markdowns that implement parts of the analysis as follows:

1. Part1.Rmd : 

2. Part2.Rmd : 

3. Part3.Rmd :

Important note for users

Please modify all paths found in the R markdowns and change them to your computer's file system. Since we are not allowed to share patient personal information, we provide anonymised and aggregated single-cell data. For some parts of the analysis we also provide already processed data that have been non-identifiable. For more specific information please contact the authors.

## Data Sources

Below we provide the sources of the datasets used in the study:

Annotated mass cytometry datasets are available at: XXXXXXX

In the same repo we provide trained LDA models for the cellular states as well as other pre-processed data that have are non-identifiable.
